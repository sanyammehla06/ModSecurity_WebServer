#Problem Statement
Part 1
Spin up an EC2 instance and install Nginx / Apache
Create a login form with 1 input field & a submit button
The form should be exploitable via SQL injection attack

Part 2
Mitigate the SQL injection attack by developing the rules in ModSecurity WAF
This form should have adequate controls for SQL injection attack and should not be exploitable

Submission
1 IP addresses of login forms - exploitable and non-exploitable SQL injection attack
x.x.x.x/page1.html (exploitable)
x.x.x.x/page2.html (non-exploitable)
Please create a step-by-step guide for completing the assignment and share that with us
Please share deployed link of the application


# ModSecurity_WebServer
This repository demonstrates the process of creating and mitigating SQL injection vulnerabilities in a web application. The project is divided into two parts: developing an exploitable login form and securing it with ModSecurity Web Application Firewall (WAF). The deployment is done on an Ubuntu EC2 instance using Nginx or Apache as the web server.
