# ModSecurity_WebServer
This repository demonstrates the process of creating and mitigating SQL injection vulnerabilities in a web application. The project is divided into two parts: developing an exploitable login form and securing it with ModSecurity Web Application Firewall (WAF). The deployment is done on an Ubuntu EC2 instance using Nginx or Apache as the web server.
